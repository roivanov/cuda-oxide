# Verify every copy of the toolchain pin still agrees with rust-toolchain.toml.
#
# The pin is copied into several places, and nothing else checks that the
# copies move together:
#
#   1. crates/rustc-codegen-cuda/rust-toolchain.toml.  That crate carries its
#      own [workspace] for the rustc_private dylibs, so rustup resolves it
#      against this file rather than the repo root's, and its own header says
#      "Must match the parent cuda-oxide toolchain exactly!".  A backend built
#      against a different nightly than the driver fails to load, so the two
#      disagreeing is a build break rather than a style nit -- but the header
#      is a comment, and a comment enforces nothing.
#
#   2. The RUST_TOOLCHAIN_TOML scaffold in
#      crates/cargo-oxide/src/commands/scaffold.rs.
#      `cargo oxide new` writes it into every new project as that project's
#      rust-toolchain.toml, so this is the highest-impact copy: a stale
#      scaffold never breaks this repo's CI, it hands each new user a pin
#      whose backend cannot load, and the failure surfaces on their machine.
#
#   3. The rust feature in .devcontainer/devcontainer.json.  It preinstalls
#      the toolchain so the container's first build does not download it; a
#      stale version there warms the wrong cache, and a component the pin no
#      longer names keeps being installed into every container.
#
#   4. The `[toolchain]` blocks quoted in the book.  These are presented as
#      the repo's actual file -- one is even labelled "already in the repo
#      root" -- so a reader copies them into their own project.  When they go
#      stale the book hands out a pin that silently omits a component, and the
#      symptom lands later and elsewhere: a missing `rustfmt` surfaces as
#      `cargo oxide fmt` failing, not as a bad toolchain file.
#
#   5. The dated commands and prose across the book and the READMEs:
#      `rustup toolchain install nightly-...`, `cargo +nightly-... install`,
#      and sentences naming the pin.  Readers run those commands outside a
#      checkout, where no rust-toolchain.toml can correct a stale date.
#
# This is exactly what happened: #727 added `rustfmt` to both real files and
# left both book quotes at five components.
#
# Channel and components only.  Anything else in a [toolchain] block (a
# `targets` list, `profile`) is free to differ between the copies, and the
# book quotes elide freely -- the check is that what a copy *does* state about
# these two keys is right, not that it restates everything.
#
# Run this after bumping the pin or adding a component.
